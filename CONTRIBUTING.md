# Contributing

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.26+
- [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) (for local E2E testing)
- Docker or Podman
- `kubectl`

Build tools (`kustomize`, `controller-gen`) are downloaded automatically into `./bin/` by the Makefile.

## Make Targets

Run `make help` for the full list. Key targets:

| Target | Description |
|---|---|
| `make build` | Build the manager binary (runs codegen + fmt + vet first) |
| `make test` | Run all tests with coverage (runs codegen first) |
| `make unit-test` | Run unit tests only (no codegen prerequisites) |
| `make manifests` | Generate CRD and RBAC YAML from kubebuilder markers |
| `make generate` | Generate DeepCopy implementations |
| `make docker-build` | Build the container image |
| `make install` | Install CRDs into the current cluster |
| `make deploy` | Deploy the full operator to the current cluster |
| `make update-operand-manifests` | Re-vendor operand manifests from the midstream fork |
| `make kind-create` | Create a Kind cluster with a local container registry |
| `make e2e-test` | Run E2E tests against a running cluster |

## Development Workflow

### Running locally

```bash
# Install CRDs into your cluster
make install

# Run the controller on your host (connects to current kubeconfig)
make run
```

The controller requires two environment variables: `SYSTEM_NAMESPACE` and `OPERATOR_VERSION`. When running locally, export them:

```bash
export SYSTEM_NAMESPACE=mcp-lifecycle-module-operator-system
export OPERATOR_VERSION=dev
make run
```

### Running on a Kind cluster

```bash
# Create a Kind cluster with a local registry on localhost:5001
make kind-create

# Build and push to the local registry
make docker-build docker-push IMAGE_REGISTRY=localhost:5001 IMAGE_TAG=dev

# Deploy
make deploy IMAGE_REGISTRY=localhost:5001 IMAGE_TAG=dev

# Apply the sample CR
kubectl apply -f config/samples/mcplifecycleoperator.yaml
```

## Code Generation

This project uses [kubebuilder](https://book.kubebuilder.io/) markers for code generation:

- **CRD + RBAC manifests**: generated from `// +kubebuilder:rbac:...` and type annotations. Run `make manifests` after changing markers.
- **DeepCopy methods**: generated from types in `api/`. Run `make generate` after changing API types.

Always run `make manifests generate` before committing changes to API types or RBAC markers.

## Updating Operand Manifests

The operand (MCP Lifecycle Operator) manifests are vendored at `internal/controller/resources/mcp-lifecycle-operator.yaml`. They are obtained by running `kustomize build` on the midstream fork at [opendatahub-io/mcp-lifecycle-operator](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/mcp-lifecycle-operator).

To update them:

```bash
# From main branch (default)
make update-operand-manifests

# From a specific tag or branch
make update-operand-manifests MCPLO_REF=v0.2.0
```

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/update-operand-manifests.yml`) runs this weekly and opens a PR if manifests changed.

## Testing

### Unit tests

```bash
make unit-test
# or with codegen prerequisites:
make test
```

### E2E tests

E2E tests require a running Kubernetes cluster with the operator deployed. See the Kind cluster workflow above, or check `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` for the full CI sequence.

```bash
make e2e-test
```

## CI

GitHub Actions workflows run on this repository:

- **E2E Tests** (`.github/workflows/e2e.yml`) - runs on PRs and pushes to `main`. Stands up a Kind cluster, deploys the operator, and runs E2E tests.
- **Verify** (`.github/workflows/verify.yml`) - runs on PRs. Checks formatting, linting, and codegen freshness.
- **Update Operand Manifests** (`.github/workflows/update-operand-manifests.yml`) - weekly cron and manual dispatch. Re-vendors operand manifests and opens a PR if they changed.

Additionally, Tekton PipelineRuns in `.tekton/` handle Konflux/Red Hat builds for pull requests and pushes.
